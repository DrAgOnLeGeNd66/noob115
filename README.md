I am new to modding and stuff, i have fun working with JSON scripts, its kinda frustrating sometimes, but i love the feeling when i have finally achieved a working mod on mindustry.

The Goliath Mod is a new Mech Pad, it has huge AoE clear and has good CC to literally push waves back.
The downside is, it requires 6K Power and a lot of resources to get this bad boy

I made several test game, to make sure this modded mech pad is balanced and will not destroy the vanilla feel of Mindustry
Fell free to give me suggestions how to improve the ship. A beter version may be on the way faster than you know! ;)
